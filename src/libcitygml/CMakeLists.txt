  #FIXME: the following file dates back to the original version of CityGML that
  # suppported both libxml2 and xerces. This fork evolved the libxml2 with the
  # additions of ADE but the xerces version was not maintained/evolved. 
  # Discuss whether we should definitively give up on xerces support.
  # Note: xerces as the reputation of having a smaller memory footprint than
  # libxml2 that imports the whole content in memory before parsing per se. This
  # libxml2 way of doing thins might be a strong constrain when working with huge
  # citygml files.
