# Installing VCity 

## List of VCity dependencies
**Direct dependencies**
 * [QT version 4.8](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/) (Concerning QT5 possible support refer to [issue #91](https://github.com/MEPP-team/VCity/issues/91))
 * [Open Scene Graph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) (a.k.a. OSG)
 * [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)
 * [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org)
 * [LASlib](https://github.com/LAStools/LAStools/tree/master/LASlib): note that VCity [embarks its own copy](https://github.com/MEPP-team/VCity/tree/master/externals/laslib)
 * [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html): when building the documentation (optional).

Depending on your packaging system you **might need** to manually pull the following indirect dependencies:
 * [X11 server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System) as [QT sub-dependency](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/requirements-x11.html)
 * [Proj4](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/wiki) as gdal sub-dependency
 * [GEOS](https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/) as gdal sub-dependency

Dependencies under discussion (open questions for MTO):
 * `Find_package` directives found in VCity CMakeLists:
   * OpenMesh
 * some MTO's installation docs (exchanged through emails) also mention
   * Python: really needed ? Sub-dependency ? Not needed at all ?
   * xerces-c: really needed ? Sub-dependency ? Not needed at all ?

## Ubuntu install (Ubuntu 14.04)
### Installing dependencies
 * Classic package installation with `apt-get` command:
    * `apt-get install qt4-default libopenscenegraph-dev libgdal-dev libassimp-dev`
 * Manual installation of LASlib
   * With access rigths to `/usr/local/`:
     * `cd VCity/externals/laslib`
     * `mkdir Build && cd Build`
     * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && make`
     * `sudo make install`
     * Proceed with building of Vcity
   * Without access rights to `/usr/local/`:
     * `cd VCity/externals/laslib`
     * `mkdir Build && cd Build`
     * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local/LASlib` (or choose an alternate installation directory in your home directory or a stable direcory why proper access rights)
     * `cd VCity`
     * `mkdir Build && cd Build`
     * `ccmake .. -DLASLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=~/local/include -DLASLIB_LIBRARY=~/local/lib/liblaslib.a`

### Building from sources
 * `git clone https://github.com/MEPP-team/VCity.git`
 * `cd VCity`
 * `Build && cd Build`
 * `cmake ..`
 * `make`

Post-install goodies (not VCity related):
 * QtCreator : `apt-get install qtcreator`

## Mac OS X install
### Installing dependencies
 * Obtain and install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
 * `brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz`(X11 server)
 * `brew install gdal`
 * `brew install open-scene-graph --with-qt gdal`
 * `brew install qt` (which installs qt4)
 * `brew install assimp`
 * Install laslib:
   * The careful version with stow (`brew install stow`):
     * `cd VCity/externals/laslib`
     * `mkdir Build && cd Build`
     * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/stow/laslib`
     * `make install`
     * `cd /usr/local/stow``
     * `stow laslib``
   * The careless version:
     * `cd VCity/externals/laslib`
     * `mkdir Build && cd Build`
     * `cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/stow/laslib`
     * `make install`

Assert that proj and geos sub-dependencies where installed (e.g. with `brew list | grep <pkg>` or `brew info <pkg>`). Otherwise install them manually:
 * `brew instal proj` (which is [proj4](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/wiki))
 * `brew install geos`

### Building from sources
 * `git clone https://github.com/MEPP-team/VCity.git`
 * `cd VCity``
 * `Build && cd Build`
 * `cmake ..`
 * `make`

## Windows install
### Supported Windows platforms:
   * Windows versions: [Windows 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7), [Windows 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8), [Windows 8.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_8.1) or [Windows 10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10)
   * Be sure to apply all required "services packs" and "windows updates"

### Installing dependencies
 * [Visual Studio Express 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio_Express):
   * dowload [LIRIS local copy](https://download.gforge.liris.cnrs.fr/meppbin/windows/vs2015/Visual%20Studio%20Express%202015/Visual%20Studio%20Express%202015%20pour%20Windows%20Desktop.rar)
   * Unrar the downloaded archive file (e.g. with [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/)
   * Enter the extracted folder (`Express 2015 up2 pour Wndowds Desktop`) and launch the installer `wdexpress_full.exe`
   * On first invocation Visual Studio will ask for an email/passwd to "Connect to Visual Studio". Simply close this connection sub-window and proceed. You will be automatically granted with a 30 days free evaluation license. After this trial period: 
     * lauch Visual Studio, 
     * go to the `Help` menu, 
     * select the "A propos Microsoft Visual Studio..." entry
     * select the "State of the license" link (at the top of window)
     * on the right column (not the Connect youself one) proceed by providing an Outlook junk email (google on Outlook email in order to create it)
 * VCity binary kit:
   * download [binary installer](https://download.gforge.liris.cnrs.fr/meppbin/windows/vs2015/VCITY/kits/VCITY_local_vs2015_64.7z)
   * extract content (installation will require 3.1 Go of free disk space) to a target directory which full path name length (from `C:\`) must be shorter than 50 characters: placing the extracted directory, named `VCITY_local_vs2015_64`,  into `C:\` or `C:\Programs` is ok (avoid unstable directories like "Desktop" or "My Dcouments").
   * Note: the extracted directory name (`VCITY_local_vs2015_64`) can be renamed if you need to.
 * Obtain VCity sources:
   * Install (from github) the [git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) client
 * [Cmake version 3.4.3.](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.4/release/3.4.html) (this version is Visual Studio 2015 aware):
   * Extract cmake from `VCITY_local_vs2015_64\_utils_\cmake-3.4.3-win32-x86.zip`
   * Extract NSIS from `VCITY_local_vs2015_64\_utils_\nsis-2.50-setup.exe``
 * Setting VCity related [environment variables](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682653%28v=vs.85%29.aspx):
   * Warnings: for those upgrading from a previous VCity version, make sure to remove any `3DUse` related variable. Also make sure to remove any previously set `vs2012` variable
   * Setup a new `VCITY_KIT_ROOT` environment variable to be `C:/VCITY_local_vs2015_64`. Watch out: this is truly slash (`/`) character !
   * Add `";C:\VCITY_local_vs2015_64\_bin_"` to your `Path` environment variable
     * Don't forget to add the proper `";"` path separator
     * Prepending your Path variable with this new directory path might be safer (it will avoid possible conflicts with otherwise installed versions of QT or Graphviz...)

**Optional dependencies**
 * [Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullsoft_Scriptable_Install_System)
   * only needed if you need to package VCity versions for redistribution
 * In order to build the documentation:
   * [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
   * [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/)


### Building VCity with Cmake
 * Use cmake (`cmake-gui.exe`)
   * Warning: Visual Studio 2015 is the 14th version of Visual Studio and hence assert that cmake detects the "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" compiler set (otherwise set it manually)
