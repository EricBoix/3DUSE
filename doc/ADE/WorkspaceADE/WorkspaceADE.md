# Workspace ADE

Management of workspaces in CityGML.
In a team involving several researchers from different domains proposing various hypothesis and future plans using CityGML files, one important requirement is to be able to save, track and manage these propositions. 
Another major requirement is the ability to easily exchange these propositions with other researchers in an interoperable manner. 
WorkspaceADE is a step towards this direction.
It permits the researchers to propose their hypothesis and urban plans using CityGML and also be able to easily exchange them with each other.
This page explains the evolution of this Workspace ADE proposition.
Note that, we want the approach to be generic enough so that we can deploy other options like distributed version control systems, semantic web technologies to test this proposition.
