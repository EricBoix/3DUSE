# How to create a doxygen documentation on Ubuntu

## Packages

	sudo apt-get install doxygen
	sudo apt-get install doxygen-gui
	sudo apt-get install graphviz

*Note: Graphviz allows to create graphs to see links and dependencies between classes and libraries of the project.*

## How to create the doc

+ Start the doxygen gui with the following command : `doxywizard`

+ Fill the first window as shown below :

You can choose to generate HTML output and/or LaTeX output, Man pages, RTF and XML files.

Click next again.

- Fill the fourth window:

![Doxygen Diagrams](images/HowToDoxygen4.png)

If you want to generate diagrams of dependencies in your documentation, you can select the "Use dot tool from the Graphviz package option" and check all the graphs you want to generate.

- Go into the run tab on the left:

![Doxygen Run](images/HowToDoxygen5.png)

Click on "Run doxygen" on the upper left corner. 
When generation is donne, click on "Show HTML Output" to see the documentation.

## How to read the documentation
